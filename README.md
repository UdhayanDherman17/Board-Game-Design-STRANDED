# Board-Game-Design-STRANDED

The challenge in the dynamic world of game design is often in creating experiences that captivate players and immerse them in a world of strategic decision-making. My IAT 210 course introduced me to the world of board game creation this semester. Our goal as we delve into the complexities of game mechanics, narrative design, and player engagement is to create a board game that not only entertains but also challenges players to navigate a perilous landscape. We hope to create a compelling and immersive gaming experience that showcases our collective creativity, critical thinking, and design prowess through collaborative brainstorming, prototyping, and iterative design processes.
